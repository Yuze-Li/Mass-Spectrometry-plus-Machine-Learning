3.Windows 10 is prefered.

4.Download the codes to your own path, and Open from the path in the JupyterLab.

5.Download the demo files. 

6.Replace the file_read_path in the original codes with a proper path.

7.The expected output can be found in the "Cells" before press the "Run" button.

8.Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer is about seconds to minutes.
